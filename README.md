### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kyler (he/him)!
I research public transit routing & computing, computational environmental science, open-source systems, and computing for equity/public good.

I'm experienced in Rust ðŸ¦€, Node.js, Typescript, React, Next.js, SvelteKit. Contributes to a broad range of repositories.

### Kyler Chin Computer Science Laboratory
**Transit software**

 - [kylerchin/kactus-gtfs-rt](https://github.com/kylerchin/kactus-gtfs-rt) **Mostly finished!!**
Kactus is a caching system for GTFS-rt data. It solves the problem of asking for API keys from many agencies. There's several runtimes embedded, starting with ingest. Written in Rust and uses RedisDB.
 - [kylerchin/catenary-backend](https://github.com/kylerchin/catenary-backend/) **In continuous development early stage**
Backend system for routing algorithm, schedule ingesting, map, and data parsing. Written in Rust & Postgres.
 - [kylerchin/catenary-frontend](https://github.com/kylerchin/catenary-frontend/) **In continuous development, early stage** Frontend system for using maps, seeing realtime info, journey planner.
