### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kyler (he/him)!
I research public transit routing & computing, computational environmental science, open-source systems, and computing for equity/public good.

I'm experienced in Rust ðŸ¦€, Kubernetes, Distributed Systems, Distributed Algorithms, Routing Routing, Containerisation, Linux, and GIS. I contribute to a broad range of repositories. 
Formerly addicted to Node.js, Typescript, React, Next.js, SvelteKit.

#### Catenary Transit Initiatives
Website: https://catenarymaps.org
**Transit software**
 - Guide to the whole project / development style guidelines: https://github.com/catenarymaps/documentation
 - Project roadmap https://github.com/orgs/CatenaryMaps/projects/1
 - [kylerchin/kactus-gtfs-rt](https://github.com/catenarymaps/kactus-gtfs-rt) **In Production**
Kactus is a caching system for GTFS-rt data. It solves the problem of asking for API keys from many agencies. There's several runtimes embedded, starting with ingest. Written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and uses RedisDB.
 - [catenarymaps/catenary-backend](https://github.com/catenarymaps/catenary-backend/) **In production**
Backend system for routing algorithm, schedule ingesting, map, and data parsing. Written in Rust ðŸ¦€ & Postgres. 
 - [catenarymaps/catenary-frontend](https://github.com/catenarymaps/catenary-frontend/) **In beta** Frontend system for using maps, seeing realtime info, journey planner.
 - [catenarymaps/catenary-flutter](https://github.com/catenarymaps/catenary-flutter) **In early development** Flutter frontend for Catenary
 - [catenarymaps/zotgtfs](https://github.com/catenarymaps/zotgtfs) **Finished!!** Schedule and Realtime server conversion, reverse engineered Anteater Express
 - [kylerchin/lacmta-alerts-to-protobuf](https://github.com/kylerchin/lacmta-alerts-to-protobuf) **DONE!**  LA Metro Service Alerts Fetch & Convert into Protobuf or Rust Structs, written in Rust ðŸ¦€
   Project was deprecated 63 hours later, LA Metro responded by publishing `https://s3.amazonaws.com/la-alerts-prod/alerts.pb` ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
